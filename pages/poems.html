            <p>
                Is it buzzing electric<br>
                or waltzing wings<br>
                that dance across this clear-cut path?<br>
                <br>
                It grows harder to tell<br>
                as the day drags on I am weary,<br>
                <br>
                a mere servant to these woods,<br>
                so forgive me when I ask<br>
                why the sky so strangely open up<br>
                and the horizon so plainly show,<br>
                <br>
                why the oaken and the maple which have I known;<br>
                the trusty pines,<br>
                crystallize steel at harsh right angle<br>
                not sprouting, driven <br>
                into the still weary soil.<br>
                <br>
                why it is only the scrappy and fearless grasses<br>
                who call this home<br>
                <br>
                The young and the bold come up here<br>
                with fire and sex in their eyes<br>
                summoning passions out of stale air<br>
                to drive away the night's cold,<br>
                heavy breaths of raw voltage<br>
                drawing charge up their desires.<br>
                <br>
                I think I know a poison or two<br>
                which finds a way through hairline fractures,<br>
                minute cracks in the concrete<br>
                some flower which, distilled, is wiser than any mortal.<br>
                <br>
                "What is this stone," the Earth cries out,<br>
                "for surely I did not forge it."<br>
                crumbles away and forgets..."<br>
                where once hid treasure, drives out gentle moles and humble worms,<br>
                and yet I mend.<br>
                <br>
                -
                <br>
                <br>
                And still, I return, drawn in by jolts of clarity;<br>
                fleeting visions of godhood <br>
                which I have known too well to forget. <br>
                <br>
                I swore I would climb those wretched towers<br>
                if not for the view, to conquer<br>
                but each day they grow taller and I, wiser.
                <br><br>
                I think I hear it, if only faintly<br>
                in the distance,<br>
                across the empty space<br>
                cruelly cut through tapestries of delight.<br>
                The Dance of the Dragonflies
                has begun.
